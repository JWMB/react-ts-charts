This project is the output of my first react dabbling.
* [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) with [react-monaco-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-monaco-editor)
* [Highcharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts) with [react-highcharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-highcharts)

Bootstrapped with [TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter).

## Problems
### highcharts-exporting
doesn't work with react-highcharts?
https://github.com/kirjs/react-highcharts/issues/92

### jest
Latest jest not [compatible](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/5119)
```
TypeError: environment.setup is not a function
```
Will add tests when this works again

## TODOs
